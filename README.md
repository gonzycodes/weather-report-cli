# Weather CLI
This CLI program fetches weather data for an optional city.
It uses an external weather API, saves history and cached data locally, and logs program events.
The purpose of the project is to showcase clear project structure, an isolated environment and version control.

## Functionality
- Fetch current weather data from a specified city
- Display a weather forecast
- Save and display previous searches (history)
- Use local caching to minimize API calls
- Log important program events
